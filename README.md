# Jicofo

JItsi COnference FOcus is a signaling server, one of the backend components in the [Jitsi Meet] stack.

[Jitsi Meet]: https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet

## Overview

Jitsi Meet conferences are associated with an XMPP 
[Multi-User Chat (MUC) room](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html). The MUC functionality is provided by the 
XMPP server (prosody).

Jicofo joins the conference MUC and is then responsible for initiating a 
[Jingle](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html) session with each participant (in this sense it is the "focus" of the
conference, which is where its name comes from). While Jicofo manages and terminates Jingle sessions, it does not
process any of the media (audio/video). Instead, it uses one or more
[Jitsi Videobridge](github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge/).
instances.

Jicofo is responsible for selecting a Jitsi Videobridge for each participant, and manages the set of videobridges for 
the conference with the COLIBRI protocol (colibri version 2 is now used, the format in XEP-0340 is now deprecated).

In general the conference participants and videobridge instances are accessed through different XMPP connections --
the configured Client and Service connections, respectively, though they may coincide.

# Configuration
Jicofo takes its configuration from a [hocon](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/main/HOCON.md) config file,
usually installed in `/etc/jitsi/jicofo/jicofo.conf`. See the
[reference.conf](https://github.com/jitsi/jicofo/blob/master/jicofo-selector/src/main/resources/reference.conf) file
for the available options.

# Installation
## Debian

The recommended way to install Jicofo and Jitsi Meet is to follow the
[Quick Install Guide](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/quick-install.md) for debian-based systems.

### Binaries

You can download Debian/Ubuntu binaries here:
* [stable](https://download.jitsi.org/stable/) ([instructions](https://jitsi.org/downloads/ubuntu-debian-installations-instructions/))
* [testing](https://download.jitsi.org/testing/) ([instructions](https://jitsi.org/downloads/ubuntu-debian-installations-instructions-for-testing/))
* [nightly](https://download.jitsi.org/unstable/) ([instructions](https://jitsi.org/downloads/ubuntu-debian-installations-instructions-nightly/))

## Docker
Jicofo is available as a docker image as part of [docker-jitsi-meet](https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet).

## Manual
This section is only required for a manual setup, not necessary when using Quick Install or other methods.

### Prosody configuration

Jicofo requires special 'owner' permissions in XMPP Multi User Chat to manage user roles. Because of that it needs
administrator credentials to start. By default, Jitsi Meet uses XMPP domain with anonymous login method
(jitsi.example.com), so additional VirtualHost has to be added to Prosody configuration(etc\prosody\prosody.cfg.lua):
```
VirtualHost "auth.jitsi.example.com"
    authentication = "internal_hashed"
```
The next step is to create an admin user for Jicofo:
```
sudo prosodyctl register focus auth.jitsi.example.com focuspassword
```
Include focus user as one of server admins:
```
admins = { focus@auth.jitsi.example.com }
```
Restart Prosody:
```
sudo prosodyctl restart
```

### Building Jicofo
Build using maven with:
```commandline
mvn install
```

This will create a package in `jicofo/target/jicofo-1.1-SNAPSHOT-archive.zip`
### Running Jicofo
Extract the distribution package and run with `jicofo.sh`.

### Certificates
Jicofo uses an XMPP user connection (on port 5222 by default), and since the
upgrade to smack4 it verifies the server's certificate. In a default
installation the debian installation scripts take care of generating a
self-signed certificate and adding it to the keystore.

For situations in which the certificate is not trusted you can add it to the
store by:

#### On Linux
```
sudo cp cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ 
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

#### On MacOS X
On Mac java uses its own keystore, so adding the certificate to the system one
does not work. Add it to the java keystore with:
```
sudo keytool -importcert -file cert.pem -keystore /Library/Java//JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/security/cacerts
```

Note that if the XMPP server you are connecting to is a prosody instance
configured with the jitsi-meet scripts, then you can find the certificate in:
```
/var/lib/prosody/$JICOFO_AUTH_DOMAIN.crt 
```
