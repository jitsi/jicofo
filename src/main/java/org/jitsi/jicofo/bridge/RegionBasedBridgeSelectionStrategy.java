/**
 * Implements a {@link BridgeSelectionStrategy} which selects attempts to
 * select bridges in the participant's region.
 *
 * Specifically, it implements the following algorithm:
 *
 * (Happy case 1): If there is a non-overloaded bridge in the conference
 * and in the region: use the least loaded of them.
 * (Happy case 2): If there is a non-overloaded bridge in the region,
 * and the conference has no bridges in the region: use the least loaded bridge
 * in the region.
 *
 * (Split case 1): If there is a non-overloaded bridge in the region, the
 * conference has bridges in the region but all are overloaded: Use the least
 * loaded of the bridges in the region.
 *
 * (Overload case 1): If all bridges in the region are overloaded, and the
 * conference has a bridge in the region: use the least loaded conference
 * bridge in the region.
 * (Overload case 2): If all bridges in the region are overloaded, and the
 * conference has no bridges in the region: use the least loaded bridge in
 * the region.
 *
 * (No-region-match case 1): If there are no bridges in the region, and the
 * conference has a non-overloaded bridge: use the least loaded conference bridge.
 * (No-region-match case 2): If there are no bridges in the region and all
 * conference bridges are overloaded: use the least loaded bridge.
